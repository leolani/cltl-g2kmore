# Structured diary

Structured diary is a Hybrid Intelligence Agent that constructs a personal diary 
through conversation from people's memory. The diary is represented in an episodic Knowledge Graph as a timeline of events, 
where the communication is driven by the information need of the agent 
on past and future periods in between and after conversations. 

We argue that such a structured diary provides valuable information to contextualize people's physical,
social and mental functioning and well-being for medical research and monitoring and 
enable generalisation over people's lifestyles.
